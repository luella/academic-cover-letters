	\noindent Dear %(Address):
	
	\bigskip
	
	I am writing in response to your advertisement for the %(Position), in the %(Department), at %(School). I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics from the Data Sciences and Operations department, at the Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California (USC). My academic co-advisors are Dr. Wenguang Sun and Dr. Gareth James. I expect to complete my degree in May 2018. As I have experience working with students from multiple backgrounds and conduct research in modern statistical techniques for large-scale data, I believe I can contribute positively to your department in this position.
	
	\medskip
	
	My primary research interests cover statistical methodology and application. On the methodological side, my focus is on nonparametric empirical Bayes methods and large-scale multiple testing, which work together to estimate and test parameters in very large samples.  I have been fortunate that my earlier research projects in this field have so naturally sparked further questions on methods for analyzing large-scale data, providing me with plenty of research ideas to work on. On the applied side, I have collaborated on the statistical analysis of online social networks and health data. I hope to share some of the excitement of analyzing this kind of data with students. I also believe that working with others outside statistics is important for my field, and I welcome all thoughtful perspectives, statistical or otherwise.
	
	\medskip
	
	My teaching experiences at USC have included instructing an introductory statistics course, serving as teaching assistant to undergraduates, and being course assistant for upper-level classes. Further, I was teaching assistant for lower-level courses at Yale and Claremont McKenna College. As a volunteer teaching assistant, I also worked with students in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods where about 5-7\% of residents over age 25 have four-year degrees and the median income is in the bottom 8-12\% of Los Angeles neighborhoods. I believe in working with students from different backgrounds to become a more effective teacher and promote universal high-quality education.
	
	\medskip
	
	I have included my %(Materials) for your review. Also, I have contacted %(References) for references.

	\noindent Thank you for your consideration, 
	
	\noindent Luella Fu
